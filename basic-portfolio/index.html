        <p>I'm not a web developer, nor do I play one on TV. But, I'm endeavoring to become one. For almost 20 years, I've worked in textbook publishing as an editor. My role has primarily been to work with authors to help them develop their manuscripts. This would include helping them with their writing, working on structure and organization, managing the peer review process, and preparing the manuscript for production. For the last seven years, I've been working for an online publisher. I've have slowly become more involved in the digital side of publishing, not just manuscript development. The hope is that working through the bootcamp will give me skills to be more formally involved in the digital production aspects of publishing, and chart a new path to the future of educational publishing.  </p>

        <p>I was born and raised in Connecticut, the youngest of four, and son of Irish immigrants. After college, I moved to Illinois to attend grad school. Eventually, I followed my older brother out to California, first Northern California, and then on to San Diego back in 2010. </p>

        <p>When not coding, I liked to read, bake, and hike. I used to like cycling. But, after losing my front teeth from a nasty fall over the handlebars about 15 years ago, I haven't been so keen on biking.  </p>
