    <p>Hello.I am an educational content professional with 17 years of experience in higher education markets. My goal  is to develop educational applications that provide engaging interactive learning experiences utilizing text, images, and video. My career started with a focus in print. For the last seven years I have developed digital content for an ebook platform. In those seven years, I have been transitioning from working exclusively with authors and creating manuscripts to putting those manuscripts into ebook format. I am now finishing a full-stack web development course that is allowing me to complete this transition.</p>

    <p>In my current role I have been able use my technical skills to create new interactive features for our ebooks, css style sheets for new ebook designs, and more efficient workflows that will allow us to output a variety of formats from our ebooks. For example, our production workflow has traditionally been to move a manuscript from Word to InDesign. From InDesign we create a pdf and an epub file. I’m driving an initiative to change this workflow so that we can derive pdf files directly from our epub files. This will give us a truly digital-first process allowing us to more cheaply produce, maintain and update our content without having to maintain distinct, unconnected file types.</p>

    <p>In my career I’ve driven over 50 complex manuscript development projects creating texts, both print and digital, of between 100,000 and 150,000 words. In these projects, I’ve helped authors create compelling content, guided that content through peer review, editing and production processes. With this experience I’ve honed project management, and relationship skills that  will complement the formal technical skills that I am acquiring through full-stack training. I can help an author or subject matter expert write compelling content and guide that content through a digital production process to create effective and engaging educational content. In other words, I will be able to provide an important bridge between subject matter experts and technical processes. The result should be effective content and powerful learning experiences.</p>
